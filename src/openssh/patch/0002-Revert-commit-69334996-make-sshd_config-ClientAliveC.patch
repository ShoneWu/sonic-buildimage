Subject: [PATCH] Revert commit 69334996: make
 sshd_config:ClientAliveCountMax=0 disable the connection-killing behavior

SONiC (and others) use this feature to kill connections when the session
is idle after some duration of time. OpenSSH 8.2 defined setting
ClientAliveCountMax=0, but by doing so, broke the current use case of
it.
