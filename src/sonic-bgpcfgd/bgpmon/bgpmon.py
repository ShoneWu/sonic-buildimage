Description: bgpmon.py -- populating bgp related information in stateDB.
    script is started by supervisord in bgp docker when the docker is started.

    Initial creation of this daemon is to assist SNMP agent in obtaining the
    BGP related information for its MIB support. The MIB that this daemon is
    assisting is for the CiscoBgp4MIB (Neighbor state only). Also for chassis use-case
    it identify if the given BGP neighbors as i-BGP vs e-BGP. If there are other
    BGP related items that needs to be updated in a periodic manner in the
    future, then more can be added into this process.

    The script check if there are any bgp activities by monitoring the bgp
    frr.log file timestamp.  If activity is detected, then it will request bgp
    neighbor state via vtysh cli interface. This bgp activity monitoring is
    done periodically (every 15 second). When triggered, it looks specifically
    for the neighbor state in the json output of show ip bgp neighbors json
    and update the state DB for each neighbor accordingly.
    In order to not disturb and hold on to the State DB access too long and
    removal of the stale neighbors (neighbors that was there previously on
    previous get request but no longer there in the current get request), a
    "previous" neighbor dictionary will be kept and used to determine if there
    is a need to perform update or the peer is stale to be removed from the
    state DB
